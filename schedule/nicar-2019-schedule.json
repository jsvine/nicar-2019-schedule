What databases will be used for more than one story, serve as a reference library and improve with annual updates? What technology should you use to house data and what tools would make it accessible across the newsroom? What metadata and documentation should be attached?",

Barlett and Steele worked together for more than 40 years on investigative stories that won two Pulitzer Prizes, two National Magazine Awards, six IRE Awards and a slew of other honors. Over the years, Steele also has produced investigative pieces for Time Inc., Vanity Fair, the Investigative Reporting Workshop and REVEAL from the Center for Investigative Reporting.\n\nBring your own questions and participate in this special conversation, which will be moderated by Sarah Cohen, the Knight Chair in Journalism at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University.
